I used to create .gitignore file from gitignore Genrator
- [gitignore Genrator](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/)<br>
- Second way to create .gitignore file as well as Readme.md during initialisation of new repo.<br>

Whenever we create new folder like public src we used this commond (git should initilise in your root directory)
```bash
mkdir folder_name_1 folder_name_2 folder_name_3
```
- After creating new folder you can check git status then you see that these empty folder not tracked so avaid to this problem you should create `.gitkeep `file in created new empty folders.
```bash
touch .gitkeep
```
- to create multiple file using touch command use this
```bash
touch .gitkeep file_1 file_2 file_3
```
